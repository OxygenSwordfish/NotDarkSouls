                    It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
                    striking from a hidden base, have won their first 
                    victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal 
                    secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
                    Death Star, an armored space station with enough 
                    power to destroy an entire planet.
					<br><br>
                    Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
                    Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
                    the stolen plans that can save her people and 
                    restore freedom to the galaxy...

			INT. MASSASSI OUTPOST - MAIN THRONE ROOM
			<br><br>
               Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main 
               temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners 
               are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the 
               beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly 
               march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From 
               one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired 
               Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to 
               an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the 
               whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other 
               dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is 
               dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.  
               She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He 
               winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who 
               is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled 
               troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo 
               beeps with happiness.
